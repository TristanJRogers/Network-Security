# Network-Security

In this project I and other team members attacked a server using various security tools and tactics. Through this project, we learned how security breaches occur and how to defend systems and networks.

During this endeavor we used two virtual machines in a VLAN. The first was a Kali box and the second was an ecommerce server. Using Kali, we attacked the server and tested its defense mechanisms. While completing the exercise, we were to assume that the e-commerce server was not visible and therefore we did not attempt to log in.

## Injection Number 1

In injection one we were tasked with creating a security policy and introducing the team to the instructor. The security policy and team introduction we wrote can be found here: https://github.com/TristanJRogers/Network-Security/blob/main/Injection%201.docx
